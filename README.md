# Salary Predictor - README

## Introduction

This project implements a Salary Predictor machine learning model using a Linear Regression algorithm. The model predicts an individual's salary based on their years of experience. The project demonstrates a fundamental workflow in machine learning, including data processing, model training, and evaluation using Python libraries such as CSV, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

Features :

+ Dataset Handling: Load and preprocess data from a CSV file using pandas.

+ Linear Regression: Use the scikit-learn LinearRegression model to build the predictor.

+ Data Visualization: Visualize the dataset and regression results with matplotlib.

+ Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.


---


## Requirements

Ensure you have the following language and libraries installed:

+ Python 3.x

+ pandas

+ scikit-learn

+ matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```


---


## Dataset

The model uses a CSV file containing two columns:

1. YearsExperience: The years of work experience.

2. Salary: The salary corresponding to the years of experience.


---


## Project Structure

The project files are structured as follows:

+ salary_predictor.py: Python script containing the implementation of the salary predictor.

+ dataset.csv: Example dataset for training and testing.

+ README.md: Documentation file (this file).



---


## Implementation Steps

1. Load the Dataset

    + Load the data from a CSV file using pandas.

    + Split the data into independent (YearsExperience) and dependent (Salary) variables.

2. Preprocess the Data

    + Split the dataset into training and test sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn.

3. Build the Model

    + Train a linear regression model using LinearRegression from scikit-learn.

4. Evaluate the Model

    + Measure performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

    + Visualize the regression line over the data points.

5. Predict Salary

    + Use the trained model to predict salaries based on years of experience.

## Usage

### Run the Model

1. Place the dataset in the project directory as dataset.csv.


2. Execute the script:

```bash
python salary_predictor.py
```


### Expected Output

  The program will:

  1. Display the dataset visualization with a regression line.


  2. Output evaluation metrics such as MSE and R-squared.


  3. Allow you to input a number of years of experience to predict the corresponding salary.


---


## Visualization Example

After running the script, a plot similar to the following will be displayed:

+ Scatter Plot: Original dataset points.

+ Regression Line: Fitted linear regression line.


---


## Key Libraries Used

1. csv: For accessing csv dataset.


2. pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.


3. scikit-learn: To implement linear regression and split the dataset.


4. matplotlib: For data visualization.

## Conclusion

This project provides a simple yet effective way to predict salaries based on years of experience using a linear regression model. It serves as a foundation for understanding how machine learning models are built, trained, and evaluated.
